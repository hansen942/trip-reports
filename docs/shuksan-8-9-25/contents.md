# Mt. Shuksan: Fisher Chimneys -- August 9th, 2025

## Introduction

I was interested in doing the Fisher Chimneys route and when Madi heard she said she'd been trying to do the route for a while and needed a partner.
We drove up the night before and got to the Lake Ann Trailhead somewhat late before sleeping in the back of the car and waking up pretty early at around 2:30 before leaving at 3.

## The Hike

First we walked over to Lake Ann on the nice trail.

We hadn't looked into this beforehand but it turned out it was a full moon, and with a clear night you could probably have even done the hike without headlamps.
We saw a few frogs on the trail, I thought this one was pretty cool.

Next you continue on a surprisingly-well-maintained trail that goes to a Lower Curtis Glacier viewpoint before leaving that trail to head to the base of the chimneys.
We missed the turnoff and ended up adding an extra half mile or so going to the end of the trail then wandering around in some scree before getting back on track, but finally we managed to reach the base of the chimneys at 5:40.

## Up the Chimneys

The chimneys themselves were pretty straightforward; there are plenty of positive foot and handholds and there are no sustained steep sections, although it is frequently exposed and there are many loose rocks lying around.

## Climbing the Glaciers

After topping out the chimneys and managing our way across a moat we got onto the upper section of the White Salmon Glacier and passed some camp sites.
After climbing up Winnie's Slide (the top section of the White Salmon), which wasn't too bad, we reached some more camp sites and transitioned to the Upper Curtis Glacier.

I had been a bit anxious to see what the glacier sections would look like as I had never traveled in a 2-person team before, but fortunately the entire route was pretty chill with regards to crevasses.

Crossing the Upper Curtis was an enjoyable stroll after another section of lower-angled snow climbing with a great view.

Hell's Highway was the last main obstacle before we reached the summit pyramid and was much steeper than I was expecting considering that most comments around steep snow on the route had seemed to be discussing Winnie's Slide.
This was clearly much steeper although it was also less exposed as you start from a low-angle area before climbing it and it is only 60 meters before you reach the flat section on top.

![hells-highway-view](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOfz7eKNCDg-Y9TKjCeXje3q3J3idMHGD-JYPq5ZNveY3Kp9SSslpteJo-HHFRFLdrwlwqSC2HsmQcRhcJOowHswR5EYm_y1f5HpDpzP5O9iP5lOfE43mIjNJ-GaH0-pRXzyUhPdDBFkxK8aiVrvOLy3Q=w918-h691-s-no?authuser=0)

As someone who isn't very confident climbing snow I was pleasantly surprised that with good stiff snow (plunging the shaft would not be possible) and the steeper angle the axe could actually be used as an additional point of contact and not merely a cane, so the section felt more secure than I expected.

Now that we had reached the Sulphide Glacier it felt like we were already at the summit but it is a deceptively long walk over.

![sulphide-walk](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNCU00oUOWeNZ1cPbCk0kohGFtxeTzyXhV75QpWvEVSF11QBFErZlcZbhXSVjtt1sDChBAZ795Y2C8bf-bq3jI60n_wv0Me1ErsClSEp6LeL2ev64vJ6NuOq8zK72xMAbPBFwpcTyNwHd9xvMoQAhtU=w918-h1224-s-no?authuser=0)

We reached the base of the summit pyramid around 10 and began climbing the SE Ridge, which is a 5.4 (mostly 4th class) alternative to the standard gully scramble, which I had heard is quite chossy.

We started out scrambling up some 4th class terrain around 30 feet left of the ridge then traversed to the right to get on top of it where the climbing became easier for a while---I believe the actual route starts on the ridge proper.

![lower-ridge](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczO1KSiuizmEC5na6v9SlUgL0cfFa20K8bC5vp5cPsOjOqUt7m7f9tINMJZ2X8P09yGUxwcuNFUGkXc86raeJMU3GDajXEHizhtO5irCkO4-lhSGWyKi7IZ0DRa7Q4QnB-fpLNrGiRna4dhhRLpBKb5I=w918-h1224-s-no?authuser=0)

A bit less than halfway up the ridge we decided to start simulclimbing.
At some point around when we roped up I ended up taking us back to the left again almost all the way to the scramble gully trying to avoid what seemed like more difficult climbing before cutting back up right onto the ridge again, incidentally adding a lot of rope drag for this one section.

## Summit

The rock climbing didn't take too long and we reached the summit at 11:30.

The summit was pretty cool with excellent views and we had it to ourselves after another group left as we arrived.
It would be hard to ask for better weather as it was around 60 degrees, sunny, and with almost no wind.

## Descent

After 30 minutes enjoying the summit and having lunch we headed over to the first rap station and made it back to the snow pretty quickly.

![rap](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMQq18udUyWgvb8ARYhcbnDHV4JCBzD2f8_p-BXacKDFRn7ilz5knsgvZDpzWhQKWCK8WnGgW1QVAwD2zMJhy5qTnbQ1ypar5Oy72tj6GhMxMwbuRKJmLeSv4CLp7aJdrad8VOwWVZnPDTPbLYyf5gT=w918-h1224-s-no?authuser=0)

Walking down is much faster than going up.

![sulphide-down](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMdlwJXIxj06l2TIRJmtLzX5FlRV2hkAbil6TbI5Oy5uJGNiLQRfsWs5OKCkKBVWh2kVSW3SryiXpIlOg55gDXzV8mDhCc04BKPjWuAXYvQvn985vKYAGUgCRSMqxU4sMX3NMEATmPMP9Iie4eqe6IA=w918-h1224-s-no?authuser=0)

Unfortunately this was the part of the day I was not looking forward to as we now had to descend Hell's Highway and Winnie's Slide, and I like going down snow even less than going up it---unless I'm on skis.
Fortunately, Madi was willing to lower me down Hell's Highway by tying our two half ropes together to create a 60 meter rope, and then down led the section while I belayed from below.

When we reached Winnie's slide I made the mistake of insisting we take the rock rap route which wasted some time since with a single 60 you end up having to downclimb a short section near the bottom anyways which didn't have a booter in and was just as steep as the booter.

Anyways, we made good time the rest of the way down the chimneys only feeling a need to rappel in around 3 other places all of which could easily be done with a single 30 m rope.
We were able to use our half ropes save some time as I could continue hiking and set up the next rappel while Madi rapped and cleaned the previous rappel.

## Fin

We got back to the car at 7:20 PM, somehow we were faster getting from the top of the chimneys to the car than we were on the way up despite it being the end of the day and having to rappel, plus having to hike back up to the car at the end.
I was glad to be back at the car quickly because at this point my feet were quite sore from hiking in the mountaineering boots for too long---in retrospect bringing sandals or running shoes for the hike to the base of the Chimneys would have been nice.

Overall the route was a lot of fun: the weather was great, the route was the right level of difficulty and felt adventurous but never too intimidating, we didn't have any issues with traffic on the route, and it was just the right length to feel like a big one-day mission without being a total slog; in total it took 16 hours and 20 minutes.

After collecting ourselves for around 20 minutes or so and drinking a spare redbull I had stashed in the car for the drive home we started heading back to Seattle.

![drive-out](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOAfO8p6gMNbVG_8-sq7YQm-R-ncL2hNGSXVcv3RHA64uTqvXhTy3IXxCRFC-A6Pmn7BXLyw8Kz-bMqeJnsBSBy-nNWhujPIhsZ2pnoZsoWVBxp_wPYVtRiJJqBYoSN0mV8Pk4gI7rFPsUCOb5oXAnA=w918-h689-s-no?authuser=0)

We got this cool picture of Shuksan on the drive out from near the Baker Ski Area and the White Salmon and Upper Curtis Glacier section of the route are visible; it would be cool to come back and ski the White Salmon some time.
