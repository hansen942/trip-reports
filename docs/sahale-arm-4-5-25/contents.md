## Sahale Arm April 5, '25 -- "The Beach"

### Introduction

After getting good snow in the Tatoosh Range the previous weekend there had been low snowfall through the week and high temperatures were forecast for Friday and Saturday before clouds and some snow would roll in on Sunday.
Scouting the forecast it appeared that the southern volcanoes might be too windy but up north it appeared it would be pleasant 40 degrees even at 8000 feet with no wind.
After floating the idea of doing the Eldorado Glacier we eventually settled on doing the Sahale Arm as we weren't sure how bad the creek and boulder field crossing shenanigans would be on the apporach to Eldo.

We set out Friday evening and found the road in excellent shape up to a gate at MP 21 (as stated on the USFS website) where we set up camp and tried to get some sleep before our planned 4 AM departure.
After waking up at 3:30 we were a bit sluggish getting out of camp and actually left at 4:50 but this would probably still be early enough to harvest the corn / hot pow.

### Up to the Arm

After walking the road a couple miles we were left wondering why they didn't just leave the gate open since you could have easily driven another mile and a half at least. Anyhow, we cached our shoes (and some celebratory beverages) near the summer trailhead and transitioned to skis.
We immediately noticed that there was an ~20 mph breeze coming from the east which we did not expect and which might be even stronger on the pass.

There was a very large avalanche debris field which appears to have shed off the ridgeline east of Cascade Peak but it turned out not to be a major obstacle as a pre-existing skin track led us to the north side of the debris field (and away from the slide path) where we could traverse unimpeded towards the pass.

From here, we transitioned several times between skinning and setting a boot pack to get up to Cascade Pass and then up the first steep steps onto the Sahale Arm as the refrozen snow was still quite firm which would have made for tricky skinning in the steeper sections but was fortunately almost perfect for booting.

The wind was still quite strong but didn't seem to be getting worse and we hoped it was just because of the rising sun and would dissipate later in the day.

Soon we were up on the arm and making good progress skinning on the more mellow ridgeline towards Sahale Peak although the snow was still quite stiff so I definitely appreciated bringing my ski crampons and brought out my ice axe for some sections.
The views were great!

### Racing up the Glacier

After reaching the Sahale Camp we enjoyed an early lunch / snack.
We admired the scenery which might be some of the best I have seen from the middle of an actual ski descent.

We also spotted some tracks of people making the exposed traverse at the start of the Ptarmigan, which seemed quite bold considering the overhead hazard and exposure on a hot day like today.

We left around the same time as another group arrived at camp and we all skinned up the glacier together.
The wind had died down and it suddenly felt quite hot in the sun; I finally took off my windbreaker wearing nothing but a thin sun hoodie and sweating in my ski pants even with the vents wide open.
We could feel that the snow was quickly softening up although it was still only 10:30 AM -- it felt much softer than you would expect considering how stiff the snow lower down had been just an hour ago and we had to fight snow glopping onto our skins as we went up the glacier so we felt the time pressure to get to the top and ski the line before it turned to slush.

Henry charged ahead as he hoped to quickly tag the summit and knew we would be eager to start skiing once we got to the top.

### Getting Ready to Rip
After traversing out right off of the glacier we found a nice spot to transition near some rocks and Henry investigated the summit block along with the other group.

We had been referring to the day as a "beach trip" considering the warm weather and a few people came prepared with jorteralls and short running shorts in order to ski down in style.
We performed an involved transition in the not-completely-flat terrain to remove our pants to get into costume and were surprisingly warm wearing very little clothing at 8500' as the wind had completely died.

After around 15 minutes Henry decided that it wasn't quite possible to get up to the summit without more equipment and time as it appeared the best approach would have been to traverse around climber's right of the summit block to reach the northern side scramble route but this would involve traversing steep, loose snow with deadly exposure for around 20 feet and the rest of the group was already getting ready to ski.

### The Long Run Down

The first few turns were a bit firmer than expected considering how soft the snow had felt lower on the glacier which was probably a good sign that the snow lower down wouldn't be total mashed potatoes.

Pretty soon we were down at Sahale Camp and Gabriel proposed we ski down to Doubtful Lake to get a longer run but this would involve climbing back up to the arm and as we could see some wet loose activity already starting we decided it would be more fun and safer to just rip back to the car -- after all we had already done over 6000' of gain so adding another climb didn't really seem necessary.

As we neared the end of the arm most of us tried to avoid a short uphill section by traversing around right but ended up in a section where the only option to continue would be to make a steep exposed traverse on hard crusty snow which only Henry took while the rest of us picked a couple different options for booting back to the ridge.
Having split into 4 different groups we all regrouped at Cascade Pass in around 20 minutes.

From Cascade Pass, we continued down to the car finding that the east aspects were not slushed out despite the low elevation as they hadn't gotten any morning sun so were still skiing pretty well. Getting through the avalanche debris didn't turn out to be too big of a problem as you could traverse past most of it and it had already softened up a good bit.

Getting back to the summer trailhead we found our cache of pre-mixed margaritas and finished up our beach day by doing the last bit of skiing to the end of the snow and hiking back to the cars.

On the drive out it was 70 degrees and sunny!
It definitely feels like summer now, although the next week should be a return to more wintry conditions with snow in the forecast.
