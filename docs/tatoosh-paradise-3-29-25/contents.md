# Tatoosh & Paradise

## Introduction

After a Wednesday-Thursday storm dumped some powder across the Cascades with most of the storm hitting the South Washington Cascades and Oregon we were looking for good spots to tour on the weekend.
It appeared the weather would stay reasonably cool through Saturday but it was definitely warming up and only higher elevations would be okay on Sunday.

We considered Crystal but ultimately decided to go for the Tatoosh on Saturday with the plan being to then spend the night and then perhaps tour on the Paradise Glacier on Sunday as west winds were expected but the glacier should be somewhat in the lee.
The forecast called for 10 to 16 inches in the Tatoosh and 14 to 20 at Paradise so it sounded like a good time and with a crew of 7 it would be a party!

The forecast was for only a moderate avalanche hazard with wind slabs a possibility but with a very low likelihood of a large wet slab also looming over us.
We looked at Gabriel's [Tatoosh Run List](https://caltopo.com/m/BM0CB) and targeted some lower-angle runs on glades and bowls that would avoid overhead hazard where wet slabs could potentially trigger naturally.

## Tatoosh Tour

### Approach

We left Seattle at a reasonable 6:30 AM with the goal of reaching the Longmire gate when it opened at 9 AM.
The fact that the gate only opens at 9 can be annoying sometimes but I do appreciate that it means I have a good excuse why we can't leave Seattle at 4 AM.

We arrived before 9 but then spent the morning running around Longmire as Gabriel had informed us that the Wilderness Information Center was closed for the season and we would need to go to the Longmire Historical Museum, wherever that was...
It turned out the WIC was open which we discovered after visiting the gift shop, inn, and museum, and after waiting in line for a bit we picked up our "wilderness" camping permit and caravaned up to the Narada Falls viewpoint parking lot and got ready.
Soon we were kicking turns up to the road and traversing over to the Castle Peak approach.

### Backside

After cutting off of the road we skinned up the face to the east of Castle and skied a run on the backside.
The snow was heavy but fun to ski as there was plenty to push around.

We quickly noticed there was a crusty layer between 3 to 5 inches under the surface and in places we set off small sluffs which slid on this surface but the snow above this layer was non-cohesive and we were definitely enjoying ourselves.

After getting an ~1500' run in we regrouped and set off towards the "Plummer Bowl" (starting at the col between Pinnacle and Plummer) where the summer trail from Reflection Lakes tops out at the ridgeline.

### Plummer Bowl

I set the skin track and tried to find the best path through some tight trees as we made our way back up to the ridgeline.

After arriving at the col we scarfed down some lunc and Gabriel and I decided to head farther skier's left to get a steeper, somewhat longer run in as the rest of the group planned to descend from the col.
The snow on the northern aspects felt much more cohesive and so to my surprise the entire run didn't lose its snow afte the first turn and we could enjoy some great skiing down Plummer's NE face.

### Denman Bowl

After regrouping at the bottom Ruby, Maya and Justin decided to head out as they didn't intend to spend the night while the rest of us decided to get another run in.

After ascending nearly to the summit of Plummer we settled on the bowl between Denman and Plummer.

We enjoyed a nice run down the rolling upper north face of Plummer then dropped left into the bowl and skiied down the flat area by the creek.

### Exit

From here we tried to remember where to go and remembered that you should traverse right while descending through the annoyingly tight and somewhat steep trees.
Eventually we came to a glade where we skied back down to the creek and found the day-trip party's tracks which led us to a snow bridge across the creek and skinned our way back to the car.
We had enjoyed 3 great runs for a total of 4800' with all fresh tracks and felt it was an excellent ski day.

## Paradise Camping

As the Longmire gate closes at 5 PM each day most other visitors to this area had left already so we felt we had the place to ourselves as we rolled up to the Paradise Visitor Center area.

![paradise-parking-lot-gear](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOCboCf9uJVBQB_HxqrxMrEsllBDb24A-kAcQouYaPMBO5-p5UxTj4uJ0dWssPUwwa7kNt15kFCYUxXDtKOxQXZ_6epp07w0RiZM_wE6kUtvLDffmqm0q8KWseBlbJpkOv0iNGJ9eB8J_oiaSDRb8BnVw=w1278-h959-s-no?authuser=0)

During the tour we hadn't felt too tired but it was beginning to hit now and the idea of loading all our stuff up to go camp in the Edith Creek Area in preparation for our Paradise Glacier tour felt somewhat unappealing.
Instead, we decided to hang out in Gabriel's car for a long while and procrastinate actually settin gup camp.

We were somewhat overladen bringing all of our touring and overnight gear to camp because we had known in advance that the camp wouldn't be too far from the car.

![ellie-double-pack](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNKIeHxlXF5cNSCJN5Nz-_MOgSMMboLsuOUjorAehCYg9f4TPG9GGmzT34ZCsI3YlbnSAsixqT5xXqGDxRcmhrS_OSX58skjAU0_S8XU7eEJ6SqzI4jCQ4Gx5ZWF5Mk_Xq9OFj718-PYu0FOxq37Y_03g=w980-h1306-s-no?authuser=0)

There was a clear sky and the stars were incredible due to the lack of light pollution as we sat on our snow couch and cooked dinner.
We also got some great views of the Tatoosh in the alpenglow.

Unfortunately as we checked NOAA for tomorrow's weather we saw that the wind had shifted from the West to the North East and would be 17 to 24 mph with gusts to 37. This would mean the Paradise Glacier would be totally exposed to wind but we didn't really want to do another Camp Muir tour either.

## Paradise "Tour"

Waking up around 7 AM we packed up camp then skied back down to the Paradise parking lot as we could then use the bathroom, refill water bottles, etc.
En route I dodged a snow cat which was clearing out the entrance to the winter route.
In hindsight it was kind of nonsensical to schlepp all our stuff up to a camp 300 feet from the parking lot.

As we sluggishly prepared some breakfast in the parking lot we watched the NPS go about their maintenance which seemed to make the 300' from the road rule make a lot more sense...
they were plowing lots of areas you would not expect so if you just slept 50' from the road you might have a rude awakening.

It took us a long time to prepare for the tour as we felt tired and dehydrated from the previous day and it already felt quite windy which wasn't a very good sign.

Once we got moving we warmed up a bit and were somewhat more optimistic about the prospects for the day although the snow on the ground was quite hard.
It appeared that the weather in Paradise on Saturday had also been a bit warmer than expected leading to more of a melt.

As we made the traverse over to the Paradise Glacier we looked up at the lines on Rainier as we had a great view.

![rainier](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPN_kEUqNPXlPS3wn4NDxCSAxjz6k466LeX6SdCvZ2YKyvQAC3JKYEWLmOO7lVBw8n0zAWlUQg8PzHjWjwg5R01zW0LWvn1zKephjBPgh5Ml0sZf72ovy06kLeydYQh6zcu2rFlrAUYlLablG4yx27vbQ=w1278-h959-s-no?authuser=0)

After traversing for a mile and a half we needed to ascend a ridge to reach the glacier and abandoned skinning as it was too hard and steep even with ski crampons.
After ~100' of booting Gabriel and I went to take a look at the glacier but as Gabriel poked his head over the top we both were getting hit with 30+ mph winds and considering the poor snow conditions it just didn't seem worth it to continue.

We decided to reverse course with Ellie and Gabriel downclimbing this section while Abby and I felt more confident on our skis.
After regrouping we headed back to the car, traversing back past the creek and passing many snowshoers on the winter trail.
One of them asked how the skiing was to which I said it was "windy and icy" and she replied that she had been to Killington last week.

## Conclusion

Despite a disappointing Sunday tour attempt this trip was great because the skiing was excellent Saturday and hanging out with the group on Saturday night was fun.
In reality I was pretty tired and satisfied from the Saturday tour so wasn't too disappointed it didn't work out.
