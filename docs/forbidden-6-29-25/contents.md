# Forbidden Peak: West Ridge -- June 29th, 2025

## Introduction

I'm a fan of making lists of climbs to do and had seen this climb flipping through my copy of *Cascade Classic Climbs*, which seemed appealing due to its cool views, prominent summit, and moderate but adventurous climbing.
Well technically the Torment-Forbidden Traverse is the listed climb but that appears to just add a long section of sketchy loose scrambling so this looked more appealing.
Anyways, this climb had been on my list for a while so this year I prioritized planning a trip to actually do it.

Drew was keen to get some more alpine climbing in the Cascades and while we considered doing it in 1 day a 2-day itenerary seemed more leisurely, so we snagged permits for Boston Basin for a Sunday-Monday trip which would hopefully also help with crowds.

## Getting to Camp

We arrived at the Boston Basin trailhead in the early afternoon and started the hike up to the campsites.

This was a pretty chill day and the views were great, although I did manage to stab myself as my crampons were attached to the side of my pack and came loose, then swung into my arm after slipping on some rocks.
It turned out not to be too bad so we just put a bandaid on it but I will definitely be more careful securing my 'pons in the future.

The route was visible from camp. I was most concerned about the snow couloir section on both the way up and down.
We saw many groups rappelling the route even after dark which is quite late this time of year; some of them said the couloir was easy while others described it as quite scary.
I knew that at this time of year the snow couloir was already on the way out and it might be possible to climb the "Catscratch Couloir" instead, but it seemed everyone coming down had climbed the snow couloir and I had heard the catscratch option was quite loose and unprotected.

Anyways, we thought we'd get an early start to give ourselves plenty of time in case it took longer than expected; in the meantime the views were great.

## Getting to the Rock

Crossing the "remnant glacier" we thought it was unnecessary to rope up due to previous reports that it was more of a snow field and not very thick.
This proved true when we saw the first "crevasse" which showed the snow was only a couple feet thick.

![thin-crack](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczPOXc0uYYaUrskcgnr3yhiNq7NRAXtro0Vk4RkSFFotI6aWgQdj_-CHBqs8E90k5O9Mix5C4tQigIJidZ1j4bDfiuwweKPezSjJ6desWYSZawzFnnx3SQTntZlWWttL4r4i_7IOYCWGikL7FqRZNV2bfw=w810-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

Halfway up the Couloir the snow climbing hadn't gotten too steep yet, perhaps 40 degrees, but we did encounter a 'shrund blocking the path.

![shrund](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOf-vrIfLboCLoE8ipQPPEttjTcvFWxZ1z8mbPWgzVtWpBDD1fdRsXCT7IAe7TIAjNfiMVSjZWRLEAxXXvC6FFv3CjQlKUUlp3JGp3Eo3yQCT0pwKgVP_tWuS58vEuFJWxxNCnmGr6QDGudMG_XK_TyXg=w459-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

Another pair of climbers who had started before us decided to rope up for the brief section of crampons-on-rock required to bypass the hole and they offered to tag our rope up then belay us from the top.
I didn't find the rock section particularly difficult but appreciated being on top-rope for the steeper snow section which was perhaps 55 degrees, although it might have been possible to bypass the steepest section by getting onto rock earlier (which would have required crossing a small moat).

## The Rock Climb

The rock seciton didn't appear too difficult from the base.

![base-of-rock](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOkBwqNhMO2FhFV2H0buVEGDg6FitKPouZ2IwpxxTpkXimAyxQMPo1XjGRWEvFni1Db5dprsNWbnscyI5GRNmI1d0cgMRlx7UJscair3JMYDpOTnJHD3SZTV7bwLNETrvwKZFAN6prtSGybUXBLgFYl=w343-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

And that's because it wasn't very difficult.

![soloists](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczM7T70ACa6Vtzd0klEJsHolEpR_bwgSKFNlKzORXvjfrbvq5RnzvkjQBk9mrOPuy-O_6_KH5js_JLx3nM75RA8-WHQ619OPZccu01T9vPwssdeLNGivTs6MvaO42oIk96I-r5-ccXSgP3slfRI0OiJf=w343-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

We were passed by some hiking-shoe-clad soloists who started (long) roping? the route halfway through (they didn't have any protection in at the crux).
I was confused why you would rope up but not tie into anything but they did beat us on the way up and down.

![summit](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczM_2kvPW4oBOGF40Az9QXyUbbVQWOgaweKpt9XwI4W7m9P6_fkf_qZtaB28AmsV5H4aYWsICJ9IbiBB9wtDtYAdioN9YN4LACFmtn_amNwDC3npcQupfTbikl9dQEmscSsjRjgmTW8kg12Ex9Cv5SWv8g=w810-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

The summit had excellent views in all directions and there was a good view of Eldorado (which I had skied in the spring).

You could also see the North Ridge Route which still had a fair amount of snow on it in some sections.

## Rapping

Now we still had to get down and the ridge was quite low-angle so we wanted to minimize the number of rappels which would be awkward and getting the rope stuck would be likely.

![first-rap](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOIekrW3r32MK51siX6Gpa3aQ1CPezO6tCix-A-ZB0PkSIC6uHUDx2PFfPeJ26VHq6osVy8riHixx7jM4I0nOgh-UA99Qge6nYLDW-zKP0DhtSnC2Nt44noCCN4v9st5tWov-TmwSipTN7O56tBjxThnQ=w459-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

After some downclimbing and a few rappels we got do a section just on the north side of the ridge where it seemed possible to traverse probably all the way back to the start of the climb, so started simul-climbing with the full 70m rope between us.
That went pretty smoothly and we were able to get back to the notch above the snow couloir in one long simul block.

![finish-downclimb](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNOhvjcYcxaPNOTGdV9y3EculcUpvGB-g_aIINI41GNU3MHMmzmDjQMtBWzfBlYrDZ0ySSQi4M1JtDaL1-kjim_rcHJOWd6oTIKGMxFWMJ3t_44iDTi9r6LsiPUWKOPeNQUS2ULNlhOdCFG8xSjdpSGTA=w459-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

At this time another group of 4 had also started climbing the route, which seemed odd as it was much later than would be reasonable to start the route.
They were also moving quite slowly, pitching things out even on the moderate terrain.

We took a break at the notch as we had talked with the group from the snow couloir on the way up about combining ropes to do douple rope rappels and they were a fair ways behind us.

In retrospect we probably should have just started rapping on our own, but it turned out that the group of 4, the pair of climbers from the morning, and us all ended up at the notch at the same time becuase the large group decided to turn around not too far up the route.

It seemed the large group had 2 more experienced climbers who knew the route well, and I had been a bit concerned about the rap route as some people mentioned finding the anchors was difficult and some were sketchy, so it was somewhat confidence inspiring to just rap the route together.
In particular, they recommended not rapping the snow couloir (which had been our plan) and this was probably good advice as the anchors hadn't looked the best on the way up and the snow would be soft.
Additionally, it wasn't clear if you could rap past the snow bridges we had needed to cross in the morning, but downclimbing them seemed daunting (in retrospect you could still rap this section by traversing to the base of the catscratch couloir after descending the snow couloir and joining the other rap route).

![rap-start](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczMPbwtnbtkYaj5i4HYADnia8EKYZUzR3Rb8fZc__IqD0ojCdPqQJT4NsRSefzHKBF_FRTM8dL9ogsT3iErL9MMezUL4uO0wj3qEqJ36VytATeiAnXKrux01SSsqhppekJrAuxnmW2LH5FL36CLQM-2T=w343-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

We promptly started off on the wrong rap anchors (or at least the less used ones) and needed to swap to double rope rappels after the first 2 rappellers had to downclimb a short section.
We then proceeded to do 4 more excruciatingly slow double rope rappels before reaching the snow, although at least it was pretty nice out.
We did this in two teams (one with a single rope rapping on one strand and the second group doing double rope rappels and disconnecting the first rope when they reached the rap station).
On the plus side, using double rappels did allow us to bypass a couple anchors that, at least at a glance, didn't appear too great, and since we were rapping together we could coordinate to avoid dropping loose rocks on each other---there was a lot of loose rock, although the anchor stations were mostly protected.

![crowded-rap-station](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNJIp_vinQqHfX-hgyTFybGGLnZs1X5bD67REoH4fBN1VBXeKGWfgtICFHFdBv2VmvKlXN19rhSU7Y_BcoW4oplcKr9RcmFMZ5kdc84qoT2o-o1okjNPKgzY-ZUKg1M82Q33XtILcJlh9Nq-Qg7kwBo3A=w810-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

Anyways, once we reached the snow and retrieved our rope we jogged down the snowfield to camp, packed up, and started hiking out.

## Hike Out

The hike out was pretty pleasant although it was later than we had anticipated, so we were eager to get back to the car.

![cool-hike-photo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczOjAuLKL-mNYoQKz2bDjlwmwDF9cSU98tiVIuAjGQrmNaQ9sYN3Baz3KOaTGBURf4CPpRQngC4ekMh7w1s-4xdtqKfuEoCCbUFS-mlhSdSuzKjd7PrlOC9_AsURWLS_ykAJMKk9MoPnCaSFg3WRh1sY=w343-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

The stream crossing was somewhat deep but still quite doable, although our feet did get soaked.

![stream](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczODNNmFvg-24mZym-jumQtt7lpaDYShze7LPxQMsBwLSi6J7CRd6jvsWZhCYaZMgxUUNo0kxudJWxb80gSdF6DZRlwlS33lzeOOGYVuKRh9ILJqnsWm5DvANUD2WcohMDz_iP51rs6vTuQh-OlNfrN-XQ=w810-h610-s-no?authuser=0)

We got to the car just as it was getting truly dark and then started the long drive back to Seattle.
